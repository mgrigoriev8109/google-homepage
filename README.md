This is Mikhail Grigoriev's Google homepage project, attempting to replicate the Google homepage. It was created on 7/13/2021. The steps that I will have to take for this project might be as follows:

1) Create the skeleton HTML of the page and commit it to git, remember to commit early and commit often
2) Set up the live server extension to see changes in realtime
3) Put the main elements onto the page such as the images
4) Create the navbar and footer, try to avoid using DevTools unless necessary
5) Get everything to space properly, ideally without having to use Flexbox or CSS-Grid. Even though they're useful tools, it'll be good for me to use this projecto to understand the basics of CSS positioning
6) Publish the project, it doesn't have to be perfect, finish it and move on
