This is Mikhail Grigoriev's Google homepage project, attempting to replicate the Google homepage. It was created on 7/13/2021 and the initial version was finished on 7/14/2021. 

Techniques, tools, and technologies I have learned during this project:

1) Resetting my CSS
2) Creating the most basic, simple grids in CSS
3) Creating navigation bars and sticky footers in CSS
4) Positioning, padding, margins, and borders in CSS
5) Commenting often and commit often to avoid losing track of my code
6) Basic html layouts, using classes and ID's appropriately

Things to change for this project at a later date:

1) Use DevTools to acquire all the perfect sizes, colors, and positions to make page identical to Google homepage
2) Add in magnifying glass, microphone images into search bar
3) Add two images into the top-right portion of page
